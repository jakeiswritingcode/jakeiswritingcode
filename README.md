### Hi, I'm Jake 👋

- 🤖 I've been in love with programming since I started in 2017. 
- ⚙️ I have more than a year of experience as a back-end developer at a Fortune 500.
- 🌱 I’m teaching myself frameworks like React and Angular to become a full-stack developer.
- 🏋️‍♂️ Right now, I'm working on a React-based web page to act as a front end to my chess project!
- 🥇 You can find my portfolio here: [jakeiswritingcode.com](https://jakeiswritingcode.com)
- 📫 You can reach me here: [jake@jakeiswritingcode.com](mailto:jake@jakeiswritingcode.com)
- 👟 I'm training to run long distance, but I'm not very good at it.
- ✨ Fun fact: arch btw, neovim btw!
